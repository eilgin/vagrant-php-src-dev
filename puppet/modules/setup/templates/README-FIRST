Hi, there!

You'll need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, register for one here:
https://github.com/signup/free

Next, generate an SSH keypair for use with your GitHub account.
This should do it:

    ssh-keygen -C "php-development" -t rsa -m RFC4716 -b 4096 \
        -f /home/vagrant/.ssh/github

Now, that you've generated your keypair, type the following to see
the public key:

    cat ~/.ssh/github.pub

Copy your public key and add it to your list of SSH Keys in GitHub here:
https://github.com/settings/ssh

I've already set up your ~/.ssh/config file to use this key with
github.com.

Next, go here to fork the PHP source to your GitHub account:
https://github.com/php/php-src/fork

Once that's done, run the setup_repo script, using the SSH clone URL for
your forked version of the PHP source, like this (replace "yourname" with
your GitHub username):

    ./setup_repo git@github.com:yourname/php-src.git

That should do it. You're now ready to build PHP. These commands should
help get you started:

    cd ~/src/php-src
    ./buildconf
    ../config.nice-5.6
    make
    make install

This will install PHP in ~/build/php-5.6. You can try it out by running:

    ~/build/php-5.6/bin/php --version

It might be helpful to add /home/vagrant/build/php-5.6/bin to your PATH.
